# Problem Statement

In the fast-paced forex market, traders often rely on headlines for quick decisions without reading full articles. However, some news agencies may exaggerate headlines to capture attention, leading to sentiment misalignment with the article's content. Headlines are short in nature and may oversimplify or omit nuances present in the full article, distorting sentiment. This discrepancy can contribute to market inefficiencies, increased volatility, and misguided trading decisions.

This project investigates the discrepancy between news headline sentiment and full-text sentiment. The study uses a manually labeled dataset of headline sentiment and evaluates its alignment against full-text sentiment, which is predicted using a fine-tuned FinBERT model. By treating full-text sentiment as a reference point, this analysis aims to assess the accuracy and reliability of forex news headlines in reflecting broader article sentiment.
